HL7 ONC C-CDA Scorecard Methodology

The best practices and quantitative scoring criteria were developed by Health Level 7 (standards development organization responsible for C-CDA standard) Structured Documents Work Group.

Define Scorecard Grade and Score:
•	The Scorecard Grade/Score is a quantitative assessment of the data quality of the submitted document. 
•	A higher grade indicates that HL7 best practices for C-CDA implementation are being followed by the organization and has higher probability of being received without errors.
•	The points you lose or gain are dynamic,  dependent on the number of elements the document has at each rubric level.
•	The scoring methodology is explained below.

Scoring Methodology
•	Document Score = Average of Section Scores.
For example, if a document has 10 sections which are as follows
3 of which have No Information and are using the "HL7 No Information pattern". 
These sections are not scored.
1 of which has C-CDA IG errors - This section is not scored.
1 of which has Certification feedback - This section is not scored.
5 of which have no C-CDA IG or Certification feedback - These sections are scored. 

Let us say the scores are 50%, 65%, 90%, 85%, 75%
So the Document Score is (50+65+90+85+75)/5 = 73% which is a GRADE "C"

 The next paragraph explains the section scoring

•	Section Score = Sum of (Score for each Rule)/Sum(Total instances for each Rule)
For example, consider Vitals Section with the following structure: 

Vitals Section
     2 VitalsOrganizer
            Code 
            Effective Time 
            5 VitalObservation per Organizer
                 Code 
                  Effective Time 
Rule 1: The Vital Sign Observation entries should use the right LOINC codes to represent the
type of vital sign being captured. 
(This rule is applied 12 times, once for each VitalOrganizer/code element, 
once for each VitalObservation/code element. So 10 observations  + 2 organizers.)

Rule 2: EffectiveDate/Times for all historical activities should be within the lifespan on the patient.  
(This rule is applied 12 times, once for each VitalOrganizer/code element, 
once for each VitalObservation/code element. So 10 observations  + 2 organizers.)

Rule 1 Results:  8/12 are using the right LOINC code. 
Rule 2 Results:  6/12 are using the right time values.

   So the Section score is 14/24 = 58%


•	Each rule is awarded a maximum point of 1 and minimum point of 0. Each rule will be scored based on the number of elements passing in each section. 

At Rubric Level:

For example encounter section has 20 effective time elements, out of which 6 are failing, we score it 14/20 (This is not displayed anywhere), and we display total issues as 6. 

The following are the detailed rubrics used by the Scorecard from the HL7 provided Rubrics.

Section/Entry/Header
Rubric
Description
Patient Demographics
Patient Date of Birth should be valid and properly precisioned
The Patient's date of birth has to have a value which has a precision to the day.
Patient's alternative names such as birth name, previous name should exist in its own name element independent of the legal name.
Patient's alternative names such as birth name, previous name should exist in its own name element independent of the name element representing a legal name.
Encounters
EffectiveDate/Time elements should have the right time and timezone offsets
EffectiveTime elements in the section are expected to have timeoffsets along with the date and are typically nonzero timeoffsets. In addition they are expected to have the timezone information for proper interpretation.For e.g if the time is being 
 defaulted to 000000 for hours, minutes and seconds for multiple entries it might be worth checking if the data was entered properly. Also if the time offsets are present without a timezone, the time may be interpreted incorrectly, hence timezones should be specified as part of the time element
EffectiveDate/Times for all historical activities should be within the lifespan on the patient
EffectiveDate/Times for historical events should be greater than the patient's date of birth and less than the earliest of current time or patient's date of death.
The Display Names used by the structured data should match the Display Name (Preferred Name) within the Terminology
Each of the code systems, value sets specified by the C-CDA IG refers back to standard terminologies like SNOMED-CT, LOINC, RxNorm, ICD9, ICD10. When codes from these codesystems are used to represent structured data the display name corresponding to the code should be used as part of the code element.
Each entry has to be linked to related narrative text
Each entry should have a text reference that is linked to the narrative text in the section.
Allergies
EffectiveDate/Time elements have the right time and timezone offsets. Future Consideration - This may be relaxed to a day precision…

All problem codes are should express with core subset of SNOMED codes
All problem codes are should express with core subset of SNOMED codes

Problem Concern effective times reflect the appropriate problem concern status
A Problem Concern of completed or suspended should have a Problem Concern effectiveTime/high value present.Similarly a Problem Concern which is Active shall not have a Problem Concern effectiveTime/high value.
The EffectiveDate/Time elements for the Problem Concern Act must encompass the underlying observations - This would be incorrect and should be modified.
The EffectiveDate/Time elements of the Problem Concern Act cannot be out of sync with the Problem Observation. Each of the Observation's EffectiveTime/low >= Problem Concern's EffectiveTime/low and Observation's EffectiveTime/high should be <= Problem Concern's EffectiveTime/high"
Problem Concern status and Problem Observation status are consistent with each other. - This would be incorrect and should be modified. This should be changed back to the verifying status along with the times.
A Problem Concern status of completed is compatible with a Problem Observation status of Resolved or Inactive. A Problem Concern status of Active is compatible with a Problem Observation status of Active.
