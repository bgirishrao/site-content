Each C-CDA document is scored and graded for a set of enhanced interoperability rules developed by HL7. A higher score (grade) means that information is coded with appropriate structure and semantics and hence has a better chance of interoperating with disparate systems. The maximum score is 100 points and the grades are:

* A+ (more than 94 points)
* A- (90 to 94 points)
* B+ (85 to 89 points)
* B- (80 to 84 points)
* C (70 to 79 points)
* D (less than 70 points)
